\chapter{Rigid-fluid coupling}
\label{chap:rfc}
We model the dynamics of rigid bodies in fluid flow and the coupled behavior of
fluid and rigid bodies. Transport of arbitrarily shaped rigid bodies in fluid
flows is a common phenomenon that occurs widely in nature. We couple CTVF with
DEM to handle the rigid fluid coupling problems. The fluid phase is modeled
using a corrected transport velocity formulation. CTVF provides smooth pressure
distribution with EDAC formulation and homogeneous particle distribution,
resulting in accurate fluid modeling. Rigid-rigid interactions are modeled with
DEM. The interaction between the fluid phase and rigid bodies is handled using
the dummy particle approach.

We consider the sliding of a rigid body to demonstrate the rigid-rigid interaction
modeling. A rigid body is allowed to slide on a frictional surface.
\Cref{fig:results-solid-sliding-velocity-vs-time-2d} shows a evolution of
velocity of the center of mass of the rigid body for different frictional
coefficients against the analytical solution. From
\cref{fig:results-solid-sliding-velocity-vs-time-2d} we can see that the current
solver has an excellent match with the analytical solution and covers all the
regimes of the sliding case.

We study the behavior of a circular cylinder of density $500$
kg\,m\textsuperscript{-3} immersed in a hydrostatic tank under gravity. Since
the density of the solid body is half of the fluid, the body will be half afloat
while coming to rest. \Cref{fig:snapshots-rising-solid-in-water} presents
snapshot of a rising cylinder at time $t=15$ s and time variation of the center
of mass with time. As can be seen from the figure, since the density of the
cylinders is 500 kg\,m\textsuperscript{-3} the cylinder floats at half of its
diameter.
