\chapter{Erosion}
\label{chap:erosion}
We develop a numerical implementation to study the solid particle erosion of a
ductile target. We follow the numerical model proposed in
\citep{dong2016smoothed}. We utilize the CTVF to model the elastic behavior of
the ductile target, while the collision between the rigid bodies, elastic bodies
to modeled using DEM. We extend the developed numerical method to handle
plasticity using a Johnson-Cook constitutive law. The objective of this work is
to develop an open-source framework to handle solid-particle erosion in two and
three dimensions. The solver should handle erosion of the target due to multiple
impacting particles. Here, The impacting particles may be interacting
themselves.

We study the erosion of AL6061-T6 material due to the impact of multiple square
particles. We assume that the square particles do not interact with other square
particles. This test is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed
solver for handling the erosion of a target due to multiple non-interacting
particles.

\Cref{fig:mpe-2-full} shows the snapshots of the square particles, including the
target at two time instants. \Cref{fig:mpe-2-full-a} shows the square particle
and the target during the first impact. \Cref{fig:mpe-2-full-b} shows the second
particle impacting the target. From the figure, we can see the chip separation.
From \cref{fig:mpe-2-full-b} we can see the material eroded due to the first
particle impact flying away. Since, we assume square particles to be non interacting
we see the square particles to be overlapping.

We next study the erosion of AL6061-T6 material due to multiple square particle
impacts, where, we allow square particles to interact among themselves.

\Cref{fig:mpe-1-full} shows the snapshot of the target during the square
particle impacts. \Cref{fig:mpe-1-full-a} shows the penetration of body $1$ into
the ductile target, and initial impact of the top body with bottom one.
\Cref{fig:mpe-1-full-b} shows the snapshot after both the bodies loses contact
with the target. from \cref{fig:mpe-1-full}, we can see that more material is
eroded from the right side, this is due to the upper square body impact
impacting the lower body.


We have demonstrated that the developed software can handle the modeling erosion
of a body in two and three dimensions. Further, we verified that the representation of
projectiles with border particles reduces the time of computation.
